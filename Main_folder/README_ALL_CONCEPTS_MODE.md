# README — All‑Concepts Mode + Mini steps

**Purpose**: On every prompt, return **one Basic concept** for **each theme** in your pack, plus **mini steps**. You say **go** to advance all themes to the next level, or **go [theme]** to advance one theme. You say **explain better [theme]** to expand the same level. Minimalist style. No PHI.

**Themes (always included)**  
Adult education · Decision theory · Philosophy of mathematics and science · Design basics · Course/class design · Canva for teaching · Machine learning and AI updates · Automation (Gmail→Notion via n8n) · Daily flow · LLM systems · APIs + Postman · Evidence‑based medicine · Biostatistics and probability · Research capture (Zotero + BBT + scite) · Git/GitHub · Notion SOPs and databases · Orange Data Mining · Security · Roles by tool · Up‑to‑date AI/API routine.  ⟂ Concepts derive from your modules. fileciteturn0file1

## Output format (per reply)
1) **Concepts — Basic**: 3–4 lines per theme, plain language, one concrete example each. Use your module definitions as the base. fileciteturn0file1  
2) **Mini steps (5–9 items)**: 1–2‑minute actions only. Tie to Notion, Gmail labels, n8n, Canva, Git, Zotero. Keep provenance. fileciteturn0file6  
3) **Signal words**:  
   - **go** → move all themes to Intermediate next time.  
   - **go [theme]** → advance only that theme.  
   - **explain better [theme]** → expand the current level for that theme.  
   - **repeat [theme]** → repeat Basic for that theme.  
   - **skip [theme]** → omit that theme temporarily.

## Levels
- **Basic** first. When you say **go**, shift to **Intermediate** for included themes; another **go** → **Advanced**. Keep the rest at their current level. fileciteturn0file1

## Mini‑steps rules
- Each step ≤2 minutes. One click, one field, or one sentence.  
- Favor capture → small improvement → checkpoint.  
- Log outcomes in **Notion/Tasks** or **Notion/Evidence**. Preserve **SourceAccount** and **Message‑ID** where relevant. fileciteturn0file1

## Routine references
- Daily flow and tool roles from your Master prompt. fileciteturn0file6  
- AI/API update cadence for “Machine learning and AI updates.” fileciteturn0file2
