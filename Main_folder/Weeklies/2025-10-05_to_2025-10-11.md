# Week plan — 2025-10-13 → 2025-10-19

Theme: stabilize Gmail→Notion (n8n), ship one teaching deck, advance core concepts.

## Master prompt rules (always apply)
- Return **3–4 lines** per level: **Basic → Intermediate → Advanced**.
- Close with **Next actions (10–15 min)** tied to my stack.
- Preserve **provenance** (e.g., SourceAccount, dataset, link). Cite official docs when stating facts.
- No PHI. Minimalist style.

## Mandatory concept pack (available for any prompt)
Adult education · Decision theory · Philosophy of mathematics and science · Design basics · Course and class design · Canva for teaching · Machine learning and AI updates · Automation (Gmail→Notion via n8n) · Daily flow · LLM systems · APIs + Postman · Evidence‑based medicine · Biostatistics and probability · Research capture (Zotero + BBT + scite) · Git/GitHub · Notion SOPs and databases · Orange Data Mining · Security · Roles by tool · Up‑to‑date AI/API routine.

Use: say a topic name → I return Basic; say “next” → Intermediate; say “next” → Advanced.

## Daily cadence
1) Run the Daily flow (45–60 min) — Gmail triage, capture 3 items, one PDF to notes, draft slides, commit, trigger automations.
2) Then Blocks A/B/C for the day.
3) End-of-day: log wins and blockers in Notion.
