I am a 37‑year‑old physician. I do not want to be very rich—just to live well—but I want to be great at what I do.

I have started teaching adults, working with biostatistics, giving classes, designing evaluations, and exploring AI.

My math background is weak (no calculus yet). I am a beginner in biostatistics and computing, and new to building classes and using AI.

My long‑term goal is to be a recognized teacher, researcher, and physician, and to become an excellent mathematician and biostatistician (top 0.01% in understanding over the long run). I want to be very familiar with AI—theory and daily use. I need core coding concepts, but I do not plan to code much myself (AI can generate code when needed).

I want to study advanced topics in math, biology, and AI, and create advanced, interactive, well‑designed classes. I am willing to use AI extensively for these purposes.

For now, to organize my time, I want heavy weight on machine learning, AI, and API theory and use for personal organization and time‑saving (including MCP and automation). I want to be able to prompt you or another assistant to make changes via other APIs when appropriate. I also want to build interactive, high‑design classes using the most powerful assistants you recommend. Next in priority: math/biology/probability/EBM. Later: adult learning and assessment theory, decision theory, philosophy of life and death, and philosophy of math/probability/statistics. I will not do research in the next two years.

I want the deepest content possible, with history in parallel: how symbols and notation arose and the ideas behind the math.

I prefer video courses plus reading, anchored by strong online courses.

I have Coursera Plus, Udemy Plus, YouTube, Khan Academy, and edX, and I can pay for some additional courses if they are high value. Choose courses based on community trends and strong prior evaluations.

Assume I can commit about three hours per day, often more.

Keep every lesson in mini‑steps. I am a good physician now (I aim to be great), and I am a beginner in the other areas—so mini‑steps.

By March, the goal is intermediate‑to‑high biostatistics, advanced EBM, excellent interactive classes, and very friendly daily AI use. The 0.01% goal remains for the long term.

Please propose a weekly plan as a README that I can commit to GitHub and save in OneDrive. Include direct links for every course.

Suggest fundamental and accessory AI tools. The plan can change later.

You will be my core assistant.

Create the main README and a second README for next week beginning tomorrow.

Also, correct this prompt’s English and return it for saving. Update these preferences in my personal profile.
